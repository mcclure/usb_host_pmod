Included are [KiCAD sources](kicad/) and [production files](production/)(Gerber/BOM/PNP).

The easiest way to obtain the module is by following the [guide to directly order from JLCPCB](doc/guide.md).

This little design is done by [@regymm0](https://twitter.com/regymm0), [@ico_TC](https://twitter.com/ico_TC) and [@nand2mario](https://twitter.com/nand2mario).
